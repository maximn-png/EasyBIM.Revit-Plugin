"""Coordination Graphics — EasyBIM BIM Management. (V2)

Sets up a clash-coordination look in one or more selected Plan/Section views
(batch mode — Step 1 of the wizard, see LinkPickerDialog): identifies the
Architecture, Structure (and optional Traffic) Revit links (remembered choice
> auto-detect by keyword > manual WPF pick), applies a shared view template
for the host clutter/annotation clean-up, hides every other link, deep-scans
the Arch/Struct links' Walls/Columns/Structural Framing/Foundations for
concrete-material types, and colors those types red (Structure) / blue
(Architecture) via two View Filters — driven by Settings.json (see
"Coordination Settings" and lib/easybim/coordination_settings.py). Every
other visible Model category (Stairs, Doors, Furniture, Plumbing Fixtures,
etc. — see _apply_coordination_categories) gets a plain gray line-color
override, so only the red/blue concrete coloring stands out.

SECTIONS (ViewType.Section specifically — see _is_section_view) get a
SEPARATE template (SECTION_TEMPLATE_NAME) with three deliberate differences
from Plans, confirmed directly with the user — full reasoning lives on the
SECTION_TEMPLATE_NAME constant itself: Floors stay visible, Traffic is never
shown at all (treated as just another hidden "other" link), and
Architecture's CONCRETE elements are left with zero override so they render
with their own native Material appearance instead of this tool's blue —
non-concrete elements on both sides still get the same white/gray fallback
Plans get, via two new per-link Type-Name filters instead of the blanket
category override Plans use (which can't tell Architecture's elements apart
from Structure's at all). A batch run can freely mix Plan and Section views;
run()'s per-view loop branches on _is_section_view for all of this.

Engine: IronPython 2.7 (no "#! python3" shebang) — matches the tab's other
WPF+Transaction buttons.

WHY VIEW FILTERS INSTEAD OF PER-LINK GRAPHIC OVERRIDES (read before changing
Step 8's approach): V1 of this tool used View.SetElementOverrides per element
collected from each link's own document — undocumented for elements outside
the view's own document, and RevitLinkGraphicsSettings (the "official" link
graphics API) doesn't expose per-category control even on Revit 2024+ (this
extension targets 2023+). View Filters sidestep this entirely: a
ParameterFilterElement rule matching "Type Name" is evaluated against ANY
element the view can see, host or linked, as long as the link's display is
"By Host View" (the default) — which is standard, well-documented Revit
behavior, not a workaround. The trade-off: a filter can't distinguish WHICH
link an element came from, only its own parameter values — hence the deep
Type-Name scan per link and two separate filters (Structure vs Architecture).

SHARED TYPE NAME ACROSS DISCIPLINES — MOSTLY SOLVED via Type IfcGUID: if
both links happen to use a type with the exact same Type Name (e.g. a round
column called "Ø70" in both the Architecture and Structure files), a plain
"Type Name equals" rule matches BOTH links' elements, and whichever filter
is AddFilter'd to the template first wins for all of them (confirmed live —
Structure's filter is added before Architecture's in run(), so Structure
"won" and an Architecture "Ø70" column rendered red instead of blue).
FIXED for this case by disambiguating via BuiltInParameter.IFC_TYPE_GUID
("Type IfcGUID" in Type Properties) instead of Type Name, for any name
found in BOTH arch_names and struct_names only — confirmed via reflecting
the installed RevitAPI.dll that IFC_TYPE_GUID is a real BuiltInParameter,
and confirmed EMPIRICALLY (2026-08-30, this exact "Ø70" case) that its
value differs between two identically-named types in two different linked
documents, because Revit derives it from the type's own persistent
identity, not from anything a modeler can freely choose (unlike Type Name).
See _collect_concrete_type_names' guids_by_name param and run()'s
ambiguous_names handling. Residual limitation, disclosed not fixed: if a
type's Type IfcGUID is ever blank in one of the links (never observed, but
not provably impossible), that name is excluded from BOTH filters for that
link with an explicit warning naming it, rather than guessing — the only
real fix in that case is renaming the type distinctly in one of the two
source files.

WHY MOST CATEGORY VISIBILITY LIVES ON THE TEMPLATE, NOT THE VIEW: the View
Template "include/exclude" list groups ALL model categories under one toggle
and ALL annotation categories under another (there is no per-category
granularity) — so Step 3's "host clutter" hides and Step 6's "Floors/Topo/
Dimensions/etc." hides are the same toggle and have to live in the same
place. They're set on the template. Individual RevitLinkInstance visibility
(Step 5) and halftone (Step 7) are element-level view overrides, which are
NEVER template-controlled regardless — those stay on the active view.

WHY "V/G OVERRIDES RVT LINKS" IS NOW KEPT *NOT* TEMPLATE-CONTROLLED (a
second reversal, 2026-08-30 — read the whole history, it matters): the
ORIGINAL design excluded this row from template control (added its
parameter Id to NonControlledTemplateParameterIds), reasoned to be
harmless since link visibility/halftone (Steps 5 & 7) don't depend on
this template row. A later round found that when the row is NOT
template-controlled, _apply_link_display_settings' Traffic call — which
targeted `template`, not `view`, at the time — set a value that never
propagated to any real view using the template, including a sheet's
duplicated view. That round REVERSED it: actively ENSURED the row was
template-CONTROLLED instead. That fix then caused something much worse,
found via live testing: once this row was template-controlled, Step 5's
own view-level HideElements calls for OTHER (non-selected) links stopped
sticking through to commit — a FINAL CHECK added right before commit
caught almost every non-selected link reverting to NOT-hidden by the end
of the same transaction, despite Step 5's own immediate self-check
passing. Moving Step 5 to run LAST (after every template write) fixed
THAT, but then a SELECTED link (Architecture, never in Step 5's own
target list) started getting hidden too — proof the row being
template-controlled and per-view HideElements on links simply do not
coexist safely, regardless of ordering. Fixed at the root instead:
_ensure_rvt_links_not_template_controlled now ENSURES the row is
EXCLUDED again (the ORIGINAL behavior), and _apply_link_display_settings'
Traffic call now targets `view` directly instead of `template` — solving
the original sheet-divergence concern a different way: Duplicate
(WithDetailing), used for the sheet's copy (_get_view_for_sheet), already
carries view-specific overrides (both HideElements AND per-link display
settings) onto the duplicate on its own, so no template inheritance is
needed for this at all. Autodesk's own API docs still note this row had
"No API access (Revit 2020)" and a direct
BuiltInParameter.VIS_GRAPHICS_RVT_LINKS lookup still returns null on the
versions checked, so it's still located by parameter *name*, wrapped so a
failure only adds a warning either way.

WHY GRID COLORING USES PER-ELEMENT OVERRIDES, NOT A THIRD VIEW FILTER (V3):
Walls/Columns/Framing/Foundations can be told apart per-link by Type Name
(concrete keywords), which is why those use View Filters. Grids have no
comparable per-link distinguishing parameter — a rule-based filter can only
say "this is a Grid", not "this Grid came from the Structure link", so a
single Grids rule added to both the Structure and Architecture filters would
match every grid in both and the two colors couldn't be told apart. Grid
coloring instead reuses the same best-effort View.SetElementOverrides-per-
linked-element technique already used elsewhere here for the DWG-import and
Traffic-link hides — undocumented for cross-document elements, but grids are
few enough per model that this is low-risk even if unsupported (falls back
to a warning, not a crash). Host grids are hidden the same way — element-
level, not category-level — because hiding OST_Grids as a category (the
template) would also hide the links' grids, which must stay visible.

SMART LINKED VIEW (elevation-matched view picker, one per role) — FINAL
BEHAVIOR, after several rounds of live-testing findings: each of
Architecture/Structure/Traffic gets an optional WPF combo, populated by
finding the SINGLE closest Level in the selected link(s) within
LEVEL_ELEVATION_TOLERANCE_FT of the active view's own Level (compared via
RevitLinkInstance.GetTotalTransform(), not raw Level.Elevation-to-
Level.Elevation — see _find_matching_link_views), then collecting that
level's non-template, non-dependent ViewPlans, sorted non-Coarse-detail
first, then '#'-prefixed, then genuine Floor Plans, then alphabetical.

TRAFFIC: flip-flopped twice now — settled, with an explicit condition.
Originally ByLinkView + LinkedViewId, reasoned safe because Traffic's own
coloring is host-view-only halftone (_set_traffic_halftone) plus element-
level HideElements (_restrict_traffic_link_visibility), both independent
of link display mode. Then reversed to always-Custom/never-LinkedViewId
after persistent "dimensions still visible" reports, since a link in
ByLinkView mode displays using THAT VIEW's own settings entirely,
including its own dimensions/annotations, bypassing both the host
template's category visibility and this tool's own element-level hides.
Then reversed BACK to ByLinkView + LinkedViewId (current state), on
explicit confirmation from the user that the traffic/civil consultant's
own file has a dedicated view with EVERYTHING non-Parking hidden —
model AND annotation categories both, not model-only. Given that,
ByLinkView pointed at that view is more reliable than this tool guessing
categories from the host side, not a regression. THE CONDITION THAT
MAKES THIS SAFE: the picked view must genuinely have every non-Parking
category hidden, annotations included — if it's a partially-prepared view
(model categories cleaned up but dimensions/text left on default), this
reopens the exact "dimensions bleed through" bug this flip-flop started
with. This is why Architecture/Structure are NOT symmetric with Traffic
here and never get ByLinkView regardless of how clean a picked view might
be — they need the HOST's own red/blue View Filters to keep applying,
which ByLinkView always replaces with the picked view's own filters, and
there's no "trust the consultant's view" escape hatch for that the way
there is for Traffic's much simpler halftone+hide requirement.

ARCHITECTURE/STRUCTURE: a chosen view is deliberately NEVER applied to
the link (_apply_smart_linked_view no longer calls
_apply_link_display_settings at all for these roles) — confirmed, not
just suspected: RevitLinkGraphicsSettings.LinkVisibilityType=Custom does
NOT accept a real LinkedViewId at all; a live test hit the exact
exception "The LinkedViewId of linkDisplaySettings has incorrect value
for the specified LinkVisibilityType." The only LinkVisibilityType that
DOES accept one is ByLinkView, which (per Revit's own UI docs for the
same "Linked view" picker) makes the link display using THAT view's own
filters/overrides instead of the host's — i.e. it would silently break
this tool's red/blue View Filter coloring on that link, the one thing
this whole tool exists to do. Asked the user directly which tradeoff to
take; the answer, applied here: always keep Filters correct, never chase
the linked view's exact cut plane for Architecture/Structure. The chosen
view still has real value — it identifies the right level/view for
reference and its Detail Level still gets checked (see next paragraph) —
it's just never pushed into RevitLinkGraphicsSettings for these two
roles. Both links stay on ByHostView, the default, regardless of what's
picked.

Prior, now-corrected history in this same spot: a previous version looked
up getattr(DB, "LinkVisibilityType", None) as a top-level enum type — it
isn't, that name only exists as a *property* on RevitLinkGraphicsSettings;
the real enum type is DB.LinkVisibility (ByHostView/ByLinkView/Custom).
That bug silently no-opped SetLinkOverrides on every run before it was
found via reflection.

COARSE SCALE FILL PATTERN (separate issue, same neighborhood): at Coarse
effective detail level, Revit shows a linked element's own hardcoded
"Coarse Scale Fill Pattern" Type Property (e.g. a wall type literally set
to solid blue fill) INSTEAD of respecting this tool's View Filter hatch —
root-caused by the user from a screenshot of a wall type's Type
Properties. DEAD END for changing a linked view's own Detail Level from a
host-side script — two independent, fully confirmed attempts: (1) a
Transaction directly against the linked document (a separate Document
from the host) — live testing hit a hard, unconditional Revit exception:
"Document is a linked file. Transactions can only be used in primary
documents." (2) RevitLinkGraphicsSettings.DetailLevel/.SetDetailLevel —
reflected the installed RevitAPI.dll four times across four rounds (the
fourth by actually instantiating the class and calling it live, not just
reading a member list); that class has exactly three members,
IsValidObject/LinkVisibilityType/LinkedViewId, nothing else, ever. THE
ACTUAL FIX, found one property class over: OverrideGraphicSettings (a
completely different, much older class — since Revit 2014, not gated to
2024+) ALSO has SetDetailLevel(ViewDetailLevel) — and this is the
override object already applied to the Structure/Architecture filters
via View.SetFilterOverrides (see apply_filter_to_target). Calling it
forces elements matched by that filter to render as if the detail level
were Fine, independent of the link's or the linked view's actual detail
level, entirely on the host side. Wired into build_colored_override.
_ensure_linked_view_detail_level's warning (naming the exact Coarse
linked view) and _find_matching_link_views/_populate_linked_view_combo's
Coarse-last sorting/labeling are left in place as belt-and-suspenders —
harmless now, and still correct if this override is ever unavailable.

# A dedicated second template/filter set for Section views specifically
# (ViewType.Section, not Elevation/Detail — see _is_section_view), almost
# identical to the plan template but with three deliberate differences,
# confirmed directly with the user:
#   1. Floors stay VISIBLE (removed from the hide list — see
#      SECTION_LINK_MODEL_HIDE_CATEGORY_NAMES vs LINK_MODEL_HIDE_CATEGORY_
#      NAMES). Stairs needed no change — OST_Stairs was never in any hide
#      list to begin with, in plans OR sections.
#   2. Traffic is never shown at all, regardless of whether a Traffic link
#      is picked in the wizard — treated exactly like any other
#      non-selected "other" link (fully hidden by Step 5), not given the
#      Parking-only restriction plans get. See run()'s per-view chosen_ids.
#   3. Structure's concrete hatch is UNCHANGED (still FILTER_NAME_STRUCT,
#      red hatch; non-concrete Structure content still gets the same
#      white/gray fallback plans get, via FILTER_NAME_STRUCT_FALLBACK
#      below — a category override can't tell Architecture's elements
#      apart from Structure's at all, the same "Filters can discriminate
#      by link, categories can't" limitation FILTER_NAME_STRUCT/ARCH exist
#      to work around in the first place, so the blanket category
#      fallback plans use is skipped for Sections — apply_fallback=False
#      in ensure_view_template/_apply_coordination_categories — and this
#      Type-Name filter takes over that job for Structure specifically).
#
#      ARCHITECTURE gets a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT treatment in Sections,
#      REVISED from an earlier same-day version that left it with no
#      override at all (native Material rendering) — the user then asked
#      for actual coloring after all: solid (not hatch) blue fill,
#      Halftone, AND 70% Surface Transparency, applied to EVERY relevant
#      category uniformly — concrete or not, PLUS Floors and Stairs too
#      (SECTION_ARCH_CATEGORY_NAMES = OVERRIDE_CATEGORY_NAMES + Floors +
#      Stairs) — there's no concrete/non-concrete distinction for
#      Architecture in Sections at all any more, unlike Structure or Plans.
#      One filter (FILTER_NAME_ARCH_SECTION) built from ALL of
#      Architecture's own Type Names in that wider category set (see
#      _collect_all_type_names — a plain scan, no concrete classification
#      needed since every one of these types gets the identical
#      treatment), with build_section_arch_override's OGS.
#
#      IMPORTANT CAVEAT, confirmed earlier this exact project (see
#      build_colored_override's docstring): OverrideGraphicSettings.
#      SetSurfaceTransparency only has a VISIBLE effect in Shaded/
#      Realistic visual styles — it does nothing visible in Hidden Line,
#      the default (and by far the most common) style for a 2D
#      coordination view. Still set here regardless (harmless either way,
#      and correct if the section's Visual Style is ever Shaded), but if
#      transparency doesn't visibly show, check the section view's Visual
#      Style before assuming this is broken — Halftone alone still applies
#      regardless of Visual Style and gives a similar de-emphasized look.

    not an oversight: a project can have per-building link files (e.g.
    BLD_5 vs BLD_7), so one global selection can be wrong for some of the
    chosen views — accepted per explicit instruction ("worst case, re-run"
    for whichever view needed different links) rather than building
    per-view smart link matching.

    Single pass over every instance in the link, grouped by each element's
    own resolved .Category (rather than one FilteredElementCollector pass
    per category via ElementCategoryFilter) -- fewer collector passes on a
    large civil/traffic model, and it can't disagree with an element about
    its own category. Restricted to CategoryType.Model/Annotation (see

    Schedules/etc (CategoryType.Internal) that were never going to be
    visible in a view at all, which drowned the real signal in ~2800

    template-controlled parameter like every other V/G row; calling
    SetLinkOverrides on the plain active VIEW while a template still
    controls that row has no visible effect, since the template's own
    (uncontrolled, defaulted-to-ByHostView) value wins. Setting it directly
    on `target` is correct whether that's the template or the fallback view.

    BUG FIXED (found by reflecting the installed RevitAPI.dll directly):
    the enum for LinkVisibilityType's VALUE is a type called
    Autodesk.Revit.DB.LinkVisibility, NOT "LinkVisibilityType" — that name
    only exists as the *property* on RevitLinkGraphicsSettings, there is no
    top-level DB.LinkVisibilityType type at all.

    CONFIRMED (live exception, this round): Custom does NOT accept a
    non-invalid LinkedViewId — SetLinkOverrides throws "The LinkedViewId
    of linkDisplaySettings has incorrect value for the specified
    LinkVisibilityType." The property setters themselves don't validate
    this (confirmed via reflection — Custom + a fake ElementId sets
    without error at the property level), so it's enforced inside
    SetLinkOverrides itself, which needs a live View/link context outside
    reflection's reach — matches the user's exact error text. The only
    LinkVisibilityType that accepts a real LinkedViewId is ByLinkView —
    which, per Revit's own UI docs for the same Basics-tab "Linked view"
    picker, means the link displays exactly as that view displays,
    INCLUDING that view's own filters/overrides instead of the host's.
    That's a direct conflict with this tool's entire purpose for
    Architecture/Structure (the user's own original requirement was "so
    the host's View Filters still apply on top of the linked view's cut
    plane" — proven not simultaneously achievable via this API).

    UPDATE (see module docstring's TRAFFIC paragraph for the full history —
    this specific point flip-flopped twice): Architecture/Structure NEVER
    pass a real linked_view_id here — always None, always plain Custom.
    Traffic DOES pass one again (current state), when a Smart Linked View
    is chosen, ON THE CONDITION that the picked view is confirmed to have
    everything non-Parking hidden, including annotations, not just model
    content — otherwise ByLinkView's "renders independently of the host's
    settings entirely" reopens the exact dimensions-bleed-through bug this
    went through a full reversal over already. This asymmetry is
    deliberate: Traffic's own requirement (halftone + hide, no coloring)
    has no dependency on the host's Filters the way Architecture/Structure
    do, so trusting a well-prepared linked view is a legitimate tradeoff
    for Traffic specifically that it can never be for the other two roles.

    Best-effort regardless: RevitLinkGraphicsSettings/View.GetLinkOverrides
    was only added in the Revit 2024 API (this extension targets 2023+).
    This does NOT gate whether _restrict_traffic_link_visibility/
    _set_traffic_halftone/View Filters actually work: those are separate

    BUG FOUND AND FIXED (root-caused precisely via live testing — a wall
    named "50_CONC" with a Type Properties compound-structure core layer
    literally named "Concrete" was still not being classified as concrete,
    while "30_CONC"/"40_CONC" were): an earlier version of this loop
    skipped any WALL instance whose Structural Usage wasn't Bearing or
    Shear, BEFORE _type_is_concrete was ever called on it — "50_CONC" was
    Non-bearing, so it was silently discarded regardless of its actual
    material. That check conflated two unrelated things: whether a wall is
    MATERIALLY concrete (what this tool colors) and whether it's
    STRUCTURALLY load-bearing (an unrelated property — plenty of walls are
    architecturally modeled in concrete without being marked Bearing/Shear
    at all, e.g. non-load-bearing concrete partitions or facade panels).
    Removed entirely; walls are now classified purely on
    name/material, same as every other category here.

    Recurses one level into any RevitLinkInstance found inside `link_doc`
    itself (a link nested inside the Arch/Struct link, e.g. a separately-
    linked rebar/precast file within the Structure model) — capped at one
    level to bound the work and because Revit doesn't allow circular links
    so a small fixed cap is enough of a safety margin regardless.

    Logs a per-category scanned/matched count via the pyRevit logger (not
    `warnings` — this is routine diagnostic info, not something wrong) so
    that if an element is ever missing from the coloring despite looking
    like it should qualify, the pyRevit output window immediately shows
    whether it's a classification gap (matched count too low) or a filter-
    matching gap downstream (classification looked right, element still
    didn't get colored).

    all_names_out (Sections only, see SECTION_TEMPLATE_NAME's docstring):
    if given, gets every Type Name encountered in `categories` added to
    it, concrete or not — one entry per distinct type, added the same
    place is_concrete gets cached (once per type_id, not once per
    instance). Subtracting the returned concrete-only `names` from this
    gives each link's own NON-concrete type names, used to build the

    """Cut AND Surface/Projection, both hatched — Surface was dropped
    entirely a few rounds back (elements were rendering as 100% solid,
    opaque colored blocks), then live-testing found a DIFFERENT symptom
    that needs Surface back: walls (unlike columns, which reliably span
    the full cut-plane height) can have their top BELOW the view's cut
    plane, in which case Revit shows them via Projection/Surface, not
    Cut, at all — meaning a Cut-only override never touches them, and
    they fall through to their own native Surface pattern, the exact same
    class of bug as the Coarse Scale Fill Pattern issue, just on the
    Surface side instead of Cut. Re-added, but NOT the same way as
    before — the two actual causes of the original "solid block" bug are
    both still avoided:
      (1) SetSurfaceTransparency is NOT used here at all (it only ever
          affected Shaded/Realistic visual styles, never Hidden Line —
          the default, and by far the most common, style for a 2D
          coordination plan view — so it was never a reliable mechanism
          for anything and only added confusion).
      (2) SetSurfaceForegroundPatternColor is only ever set when fill_id
          actually resolved to a real pattern (same guard already used
          for the Cut side) — setting a color with no pattern in place
          tints the element's own inherent Surface pattern instead
          (often Solid), which was the second real contributor to the
          original bug.
    SetDetailLevel(Fine), below, forces Fine for the WHOLE element this
    override applies to — Cut and Surface both — so it protects both
    sides against Coarse-driven native patterns equally; re-adding
    Surface here doesn't reopen that particular risk.

    All boundary lines are Solid — a dashed line pattern for columns was
    tried and then explicitly reversed per earlier live-testing feedback.
    Only the line color and the diagonal hatch differ between Structure
    (red) and Architecture (blue).

    Grids have no Cut OR Surface representation in the sense this
    function overrides (they're a projection-LINE-only datum category,
    no fillable face at all) — see build_grid_line_override for the
    separate, minimal override that actually colors a Grid line.

    THE REAL FIX for Coarse Scale Fill Pattern (a linked element's own
    Type Property, e.g. a wall type hardcoded to solid blue fill, winning
    over this hatch when the effective detail level is Coarse — see the
    module docstring's DEAD END paragraph for everything that does NOT
    work): OverrideGraphicSettings.SetDetailLevel(ViewDetailLevel), found
    by reflecting the installed RevitAPI.dll one property class over from
    where several earlier rounds were looking. This is a COMPLETELY
    different class from RevitLinkGraphicsSettings — it's the override
    object already being applied to elements via View.SetFilterOverrides
    (see apply_filter_to_target), available since Revit 2014, and (unlike
    everything tried against RevitLinkGraphicsSettings/the linked document
    itself) forces the elements THIS FILTER matches to render as if the
    detail level were Fine, regardless of the link's or the linked view's
    actual detail level — no linked-document Transaction involved at all,
    confirmed by actually instantiating the class and calling
    SetDetailLevel(Fine) live via .NET reflection, not just reading a

        # could be either.

        # BUG FOUND AND FIXED (root-caused via live testing: the filter
        # never appeared in Revit's own Filters list at all, for ANY
        # picked element): an earlier version of this collected every
        # CategoryType.Model category from doc.Settings.Categories by
        # hand. Not every category Revit shows in that list is actually
        # usable in a ParameterFilterElement — ParameterFilterElement.
        # Create THROWS if even ONE category in the list it's given isn't
        # filterable, failing the ENTIRE filter creation, not just that
        # one category (confirmed via reflecting the installed
        # RevitAPI.dll: ParameterFilterUtilities.GetAllFilterableCategories
        # /RemoveUnfilterableCategories exist specifically because of this
        # constraint). Fixed by sourcing categories from
        # GetAllFilterableCategories() directly instead of hand-rolling
        # the list — Revit's own authoritative "these are safe to use in a
        # Filter" source, which also naturally includes the Annotation
        # categories the hand-rolled Model-only version excluded.
        #
        # SECOND BUG FOUND AND FIXED, same live-testing round: even with
        # GetAllFilterableCategories() (all individually filterable),
        # ParameterFilterElement.Create STILL threw — "One of the given
        # rules refers to a parameter that does not apply to this filter's
        # categories" — because "Type Name" (ALL_MODEL_TYPE_NAME) isn't a
        # valid/filterable parameter for every one of those ~150+
        # categories at once (e.g. purely 2D/analytical ones). The same
        # "one bad apple fails the whole Create call" behavior as the
        # category-list bug above, just for the RULE's parameter instead
        # of the category list. Fixed by checking, per candidate category,
        # whether ALL_MODEL_TYPE_NAME is actually in
        # ParameterFilterUtilities.GetFilterableParametersInCommon(doc,
        # [that one category]) — confirmed via reflection this is the
        # correct per-category applicability check (IsParameterApplicable
        # takes an Element, not a category, so it doesn't fit this
        # "before any element exists" use case) — and only keeping
